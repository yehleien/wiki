## Abstract

liminal is an internet company that makes it easy to trust the different truths you hear online. It anonymizes and hides everything about the identity of the poster, **except for the verified perspective or perspectives they chose to comment with**. Information on the internet is accessed via URLs - *universal* resource locators. Our platform verifies the data you provide about yourself and your experiences, with clear public guidelines, and allows you to comment on all of part of a universal resource locator with our tool, and for others who share your perspective or mix of [[perspectives]] to agree (upvote), disagree (downvote), or reply to your comment.

liminal is an internet platform that allows every truth to be heard. By stripping away all of the extraneous elements that exist in online communication today, we facilitate an immediate communication of only the necessary 

## How to Use

#### signing up and obtaining perspectives
1. visit our website and create an account (maybe biometric information, SSN, phone number, something unique that can only be used once if verified or something? Or just a normal sign up process)
2. find your perspective and verify it - connect to an online portal, request documents to be scanned, etc. Whatever the specific connection needs. 

#### using the platform
1. while using the internet, paste the URL into our website (not the same as registration), or use the browser addon (in roadmap) to view comments side by side with the webpage (ideally text, it will start with only text but can expand ie youtube videos)
2. you will see all of the comments left by all users on our website of the *source url* once you past the URL into our website 
	1. you can filter by perspective, view count, votes, etc. any method you want can be preset and easily switchable, to adapt to your biases and also make it easy to see what other people are saying / thinking
3. you can leave a comment on any piece of the information, or the information as a whole (part of an article or the whole thing) and this will start a new *thread* in our main marginal perspective database

basically its a library of the web with one conversation dedicated to every URL. no other frills or aspects except to facilitate conversation around specific URLS. like an old school forum meets twitter meets 4chan - this platform is purpose built for one reason - to faciliate these conversations



## Elements Overview

### Perspectives

#### what is a perspective?
a perspective as defined from here on out is an objective, undeniably factual, and ***verifiable*** truth about an individual. 

Example Perspectives

| perspective | potential verification methods | 
|----------|---------------|
| mother / father | Hospital Records, Tax Forms, Genetic Tests, Insurance Documents |
| doctor | MCAT records, hospital records, tax forms, professional society membership |
| millionaire | bank account connection, stock trading forms, credit check | 
| below poverty line | see above | 
| republican / democrat | official databases of the parties, public records |

It would be a snowball effect, where once we have access to some things we have access to lots of things - see [[connecting to a database]]  for more info on that. If we can establish that kind of connection, or something like it, with a medical database or legal one, tax records etc, we could scale upwards quickly once we have one connection established. 

#### how are perspectives used?


the above is an example of what the platform could look like in use. no accounts, no pages, no usernames, in some ways it is an antisocial network but its not for reasons I will figure out later, I can feel it tho 

### threads
1. a thread is a comment posted by a user using one or more perspectives on a url. got it? (lol)
2. a thread has 3 actions
	1. upvote 
	2. downvote 
	3. reply (add a child comment with the same rules)
3. a user can only act on a thread if they share the exact same perspective/perspective mix as the user of the parent comment of the thread. you can add more perspectives, say a mother of 4 who is a doctor comments on an article about childbirth and a mother of 4 who is a doctor and who is a doula replies to the comment with additional information.

## Business Strategy 
we are a matchmaking platform. We connect 2 groups of people: those who want to tell their truth, and those who want to listen to a truth. The truths exchanged are the essence of the platform and the product that we sell is the feeling of having any truth you want at your fingertip.
				*and that is why I will call the company truth social, lol*

Customers will find out about our platform through our customer acquisition methods, discussed below in greater detail. 

### How do we make money?
Data mining as it exists today is largely viewed as bad. it is viewed that way because it's your personal information. But what if it didn't have to be? With Marginal perspective as a trusted intermediary between customers and their data, we can sell blank-graphic information on groups of people, without identifying anybody individually. Ethical Data Sales. 

or....

We offer businesses demographic information on groups they are interested in. Selling searches in an engine that will tell you what 25 year old women who are nurses in philadelphia think about a certain topic, etc, is valuable. But we need to hit critical mass for that to happen, so maybe its not the best idea to start. 

or.... 

We create an auction platform of questions and answers. This would probably involve some sort of crypto but fuck that shit, too buzzy. If I want to know if a doctor agrees with something I read in an article, I can post the question on the platform. 1,000 doctors can agree type out an answer for $5 each, and if enough people have the same question, 10,000 people can chip in $2 each and see the answer from the 1,000 doctors. (maybe think of a better example.....) there can also be discussion on the question and answer of course. And if you could set bounds, like to buy a single answer, the potential to grow increases. 

If this above idea is how we make money, our customer acquisition strategy changes in some way. Maybe just our advertising and messaging, maybe in the very customers who would be early adopters. Let's flesh this out a lot more. 


### Things we will NOT do to make money
1. sell ad space on any aspect of the platform as it is being used by customers
2. do anything that reveals any identity of anybody to any individual, group, organization, or party 
3. charge a fee for the platform to be used 
### Competitors

* Twitter

### **problem to solve**



internet users are not motivated to contribute; engagement is enragement

### **mvp solution**

a simple website with users, articles, and perspectives which all discussions are based around

### **target market**


1. postsecondary students
2. automotive enthusiasts
3. felons

### **value proposition**


1. you want to hear from others in your group but how can you trust they are in the group?
2. get insights you can trust from people who have been there before, own the same car, or have the same degree

### Customer Acquisition Strategy 

#### Finding customers where they are
Some might say the purpose of the internet is to foster this type of truths discussion, and there are examples of it everywhere on the internet. It is not certain communities to target, but we are targeting the top 1% of members of every communities at first. Those are not the richest, or loudest, but the most trusted. Doctors who have been on reddit for a long time in medical subreddits and are known to give good advice, lawyers, politicians, people who have 10+ year stackoverflow, quora (if possible), obscure forums (die_menswear on twitter), etc. The gamble is that people who fit that criteria will understand the need for this platform, as well as be the our early adopters because they are the customers who most desperately want truth to be told, as we can see through their history online as known truth tellers. 

#### how do we convince them to use our platform? 
we are not trying to convince them to leave their current platform. Marginal perspective does not have a home like twitter.com etc, it lives through URLs that have conversations attached to them. You are able to have a conversation on a reddit.com thread just as easily as a newspaper article. In some sense, we are asking them to leave their platform as we are trying to get people to spend time on ours. But in another sense, ours does not survive without theirs, so we are not trying to upend the entire social media game here, but only enhance it. Along with every other URL. We work on all platforms, all you need is an internet connection. The technical challenge ahead is vast but not insurmountable, and this can be accomplished using technologies we have today. I feel like this has been inevitable and I am thrilled at the opportunity to create it, I can't believe other people haven't done it in the 7 years I have been stewing over this in my mind. It's 2023, July, and I am finally leaving JoGo and able to put pen to paper and get this fucker rolling. 

## Asides 

#### a good thing about twitter 
is that you know everybody is a person, or at least hope so - the bot problem is a separate issue. You know everybody is a person, and a person has emotions, past experiences, and a million unique factors that make them the person that they are. So when they have something to say, you take it as a person saying it to you. 
	* lots of times on twitter people say they are something they are not and you can either trust them at face value, (oh this is a doctor saying this), or do your own research on them and find out they are a quack, lost license, chiropractor, etc. So is that person really a doctor? Or are they faking it? How should you interpret what they say?
	* This is I believe the where the echo chamber fits in - its nice to hear what you think over and over again because you can lean into your bias subconsciously and trust those people who say things you like, because you can presume they have at least something in common with you. 
		* insert note about dogwhistle here?
	* That is what is so great about liminal. You get the same interactivity, similar UX, and sense of feeling that a person is saying something, not a bot or journalist who gets edited, etc, **and** you know that they are whatever their perspective is, because you can trust our platform
		* if we say somebody is a doctor, there is a public dictionary of sorts that shows how we verified that, and that we did verify it again when they posted that comment. Then you know the same about everybody who agrees, disagrees with them, etc. 


### Critical Mass 
when we have enough users that 

### how do you know if / how many people are commenting on a website? 

### idea for expansion 
Use Shazam and AI etc to combine pieces of content to filter out like every meme that is reposted would be known and all comments would be about the piece of media that we identified so it could be a YouTube video embedded in a website and you can see the comments or a gif that has no explanation we could analyze and turn into something that anybody can comment on or talk about 

Can start threads with different rules and invite people or post them publicly - certain perspective mixes can comment etc 

## Future Additions
### The Feed 

a twitter-esque page of tons of different perspectives that we think you would like - based on your interactions on other posts. Based on the posts sources, sentiment, your upvotes, downvotes, other perspectives, etc - we create an algorithm that will show you perspectives of who posted what, other elements of your profile (tbd) still totally anonymous. #Q Should people be allowed to just post things as a perspective? definitely. #Q Should there be different feeds?

### Communities

communities that you can only enter if you meet the perspective criteria. default in? shows # of active and # of potential users? Should anybody be able to see the communities, but you can only comment if you meet the perspectives? Can there be different communities based on communities? like this is a bad example, but men over 50 could have a lot of bullshit to say about the immigrant community or other stuff like that. If we open the doors to this idk if we could avoid it, but nvm it would be easy to prohibit metacomments on liminal owned forums. Need to call it something cooler than forums. 

### Question & Answer Platform 

COVID19 hits. You are a believer in science, but want to get the opinion of doctors. (Michael Lewis Going Infinite, SBF built a platform that can get the consensus of experts on anything quickly - this would be like that) You are not alone. You put a penny, a dollar, or something else, maybe we dont pay people? but that makes more sense. But we can get the consensus of 1000 doctors about a specific question, or like a quora board with more trust and potentially random shit? This would be just like quora...... but on our platform. #Q What makes this subset platform different than quora?
